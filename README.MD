# The design of A multicycle processor using VHDL Language

- The idea behind A multi cycle processor is that each instruction takes the neccessary number of cycles 
- for example if an instruction does not need a stage(Fetch-decode-execute-memory-write back) it will not waste its time

- Unlike the Single cycle microarchitecture ,We use a microprogrammed control unit (A finite state machine ).
